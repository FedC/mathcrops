<b>Conceptual and sample game framework for Android using OpenGL ES technology</b

<p>
This source code simply porvides my solution to common OpenGL ES problems
such as when and how to load textures, how to map the 
user's input on the 2D screen to OpenGL's 3D worldview in order to 
do simple drag and drop actions, when and how to load sounds, and 
designing a responsive GUI.
